## Project Members

## Project Description
Creating a web application that allow users to input their questions and number of tarot cards they want to draw and the application
will randomly draw tarot cards and includes images of the cards and a short description of the card as the reading.

We plan to mimic some functionalities that official web application like remembering the last user that logged
into the web application. We also wanted to explore more about database management and how to store and update user data.
